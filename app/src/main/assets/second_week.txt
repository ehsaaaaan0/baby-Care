Woo-hoo! You made it through the first week with your newborn! The first week is usually the hardest. You both are figuring out your new role as parents, so be patient with yourself and your partner. By now your baby is more stable and your body is recovering and feeling stronger. Your baby will show a bit more personality by now. You might notice that she tends to be sleepy while feeding, impatient when changing the diaper, or loves to listen to Daddy's voice. At this time babies are moving in and out of several different states from sleepiness to quiet alertness to active alertness.
Weight
Your baby will have reached her birth weight and started gaining more. This means you might feed more often or longer. Make sure you rest with your baby in between feedings so you have enough energy to take care of your precious one.
Communication
Your baby will react to you and usually loves to be held, kissed and carried. Your baby will hear your voice and turn her head towards you once you speak. For some reason Dad's voice can be especially soothing. All babies love music and rhythm so include that in your daily routine. You might notice that whenever you put your baby down to sleep, she starts to cry. This is normal since babies don't know you are still around when they don't smell or feel you.
Cord
The cord will be dryer or already have fallen off. Keep the area dry so it heals well.
Skin
Many babies develop acne or dry skin after birth. This is a normal hormonal change and reaction to being outside of the womb. It can take days or months for baby acne to go away.
Crying
By week two, your baby may be crying more. She might be colicky or overwhelmed from new encounters like a new sound, person or smell. Especially in the evening babies develop "cluster-feeding" and are fussy. Feed often if necessary and keep your baby close to you in a calm environment.
